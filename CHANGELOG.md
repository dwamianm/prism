## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added

- `engine.reinforce()` method — bumps `reinforcement_boost` (+0.15, cap 0.5) and `confidence_base` (+0.05, cap 0.95), updates `last_reinforced_at`, appends evidence refs
- Re-mention reinforcement in `store()` — opt-in via `reinforce_similarity_threshold` config; vector-searches for similar existing nodes and reinforces them automatically
- Keyword-based supersedence detection in `store()` — opt-in via `enable_store_supersedence` config; `ContentContradictionDetector` with 10 regex patterns for migration/replacement language
- Oscillation detection for flip-flop supersedence patterns — `OscillationDetector` using Jaccard keyword similarity on supersedence chains; applies confidence penalty (0.1 per cycle, cap 0.3)
- `update_node()` method on `GraphStore` protocol and all implementations (DuckPGQ, PostgreSQL) for field-level node updates
- Ranking assertions in simulation harness (`SimCheckpoint.ranking_assertions`)
- Lifecycle assertions in simulation harness (`SimCheckpoint.lifecycle_assertions`)
- Deterministic rebuild verification (`SimulationRunner.run_deterministic_check()`)
- Surprise-gated storage — opt-in via `enable_surprise_gating` config; `NoveltyScorer` computes novelty of incoming content against existing memory, boosting salience for novel content and penalizing redundant content
- Four new simulation scenarios: `reinforcement`, `remention`, `oscillation`, `surprise_gating`

### Fixed

- `promotion_evidence_count` default aligned with `store()` behavior (default 1, matching the single evidence ref created per node)

### Changed

- `store()` pipeline now has 6 steps: event persistence, graph node creation, vector/lexical indexing, re-mention reinforcement (opt-in), supersedence + oscillation detection (opt-in), surprise gating (opt-in)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- Self-organizing memory system (RFC-0015) with virtual decay, maintenance runner, and organizer jobs
- Simulation harness for validating memory behavior without LLM dependencies
- Decay mechanics: exponential salience/confidence decay with per-type decay profiles
- Organizer jobs: promote, decay_sweep, archive, feedback_apply (plus stubs for future jobs)
- Opportunistic maintenance during retrieve/ingest operations
- Three simulation scenarios: `changing_facts`, `decay_mechanics`, `information_accumulation`

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- Append-only event store (DuckDB)
- Graph-based relational model with typed nodes and edges
- Vector index (usearch HNSW) with fastembed embeddings
- Lexical full-text search (Tantivy)
- Hybrid retrieval pipeline with deterministic scoring and context packing
- Epistemic state model with lifecycle transitions and confidence tracking
- LLM-powered ingestion pipeline (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama)
- Entity merge and supersedence handling
- Namespace and scope isolation
- Optional PostgreSQL backend
- Terminal chat example with persistent memory
- Quickstart example
